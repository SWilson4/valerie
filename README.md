# Valerie
## A pink theme for Vim

My girlfriend's primary objection to using Vim was that the colour palette was limited. In contrast, VSCode had a wide range of colour themes, including at least one which was pink enough for her tastes. None of the existing Vim themes were quite right, so I wrote one for her.

At the moment, this theme supports only very limited syntax highlighting (nothing filetype-specific) and will only work on a 256-colour terminal.

### Installation
- Vim 8:
    - ```git clone https://github.com/SWilson4/valerie ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start```

To activate, type the command `:colorscheme valerie` or add the line `colorscheme valerie` to your `.vimrc` file.
